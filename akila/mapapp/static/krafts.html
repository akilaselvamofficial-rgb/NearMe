        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The Keezhadi region in Sivagangai district is famous for its rich archaeological discoveries that highlight the artistic skills of the ancient Tamil civilization. The artefacts found in the Keezhadi excavation—such as pottery, terracotta beads, spindle whorls, etched stones, metal tools, and beautifully designed clay objects—show the high craftsmanship and cultural development of the people who lived there more than 2,000 years ago. The fine pottery with geometric designs, well-polished beads, and household tools reflect their everyday life, creativity, and advanced knowledge of art and craft. Keezhadi’s findings prove that the people of the Sangam age were skilled artisans who practiced weaving, pottery-making, metalwork, and bead-making with great precision. Today, Keezhadi stands as a proud symbol of Tamil Nadu’s artistic heritage and continues to inspire interest in ancient crafts and culture.</p>
